# Notes

## Introduction

I learned about this data from Jeremy Singer-Vines' [Data Is Plural](https://data-is-plural.com) 2023.05.31 edition

> Local business. Despite the name, the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns datasets cover a range of geographic units, including states, congressional districts, metro areas, counties, and ZIP codes. Generated from the Bureau’s confidential Business Register, they provide the number of establishments and (noise-infused) employee counts and payroll figures, disaggregated by industry code. Last month, the Bureau released the data for 2021. Historical availability varies; the Bureau directly provides data for counties back to 1986, and for ZIP codes back to 1994, for example. Fabian Eckert and colleagues, meanwhile, have converted two older archives of the records into comparable data, spanning 1946 to 1974 and 1975 onward.

## Sources and reference files

I downloaded data from <https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2021/econ/cbp/2021-cbp.html> on 2023-06-04. Specifically: Complete County File [102.9 MB] <https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/datasets/2021/cbp21co.zip> and all years from 2001 onward.

The CSV files are like this:

The categories and codes changed a lot over the decades. I considered using Ekert et al.'s method^[Fabian Eckert, Teresa C. Fort, Peter K. Schott, and Natalie J. Yang. "Imputing Missing Values in the US Census Bureau's County Business Patterns." 
NBER Working Paper #26632, 2021. Data and documentation at <https://www.fpeckert.me/cbp/> ] to deal with this (and I made an attempt). However I found it difficult to be sure I was implementing the method correctly, so I limited my usage to sector totals to minimize the impact of changing categories... as well as limiting myself to data starting in 2001 by which time the categories and codes were much more stable.
